## History & Legacy
The Aurion Imperium once united Arcanis under Ether-engineered wonders but collapsed in a catastrophic event—possibly an internal Ether war or attempts to harness unstoppable “Divine Gears.” Their ruins and leftover technology still shape Arcanis, as modern factions compete to unearth, reactivate, or safeguard these powerful relics. Myths like The Sleeper Below and The Shattered Star Fable color local folklore and drive questing parties to venture into dangerous frontiers.
