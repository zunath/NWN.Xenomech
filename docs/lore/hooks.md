## Adventuring & Story Hooks

- **Faction Conflicts**: Mediate or exploit the rivalry between House Verain’s quest for dominance and the Vanguard Wardens’ guardianship.
- **Artifact Hunts**: Race Twilight Consortium operatives to salvage advanced mechs or star-shards before they hit the black market.
- **Alien Incursions**: Thwart Serrakis terraforming efforts or broker uneasy truces to repel bigger cosmic threats.
- **Religious Quests**: Join cult pilgrimages in the Overgrown Expanse, protect Ember Rites, or guide Boneflow ceremonies plagued by undead anomalies.
- **Personal Journeys**: Uncover a PC’s hidden ties to lost Aurion knowledge, develop cross-class Resonance Node synergies, or safeguard a discovered Divine Gear.
