## Detailed Mech Types

### A. Aurion Frames
- **Definition & Role**: Standard Imperium-built mechs; backbone for defense, infrastructure, and exploration; require pilots.
- **Historical Background**: Deployed for war, extraction, public works; modular; abandoned post-collapse.
- **Key Characteristics**: Ether-powered engines; modularity; robust but non-sentient.
- **Variants & Subtypes**:
  - Common Combat: Spearhead Unit (frontline), Bulwark Unit (siege/defense).
  - Industrial & Utility: Mineral Excavators, Transport Loaders.
  - Specialized Recon: Skystalker (limited flight), Underwater Adaptations (rare).
- **Contrast**: Pilot-required vs. autonomous Epsilon; mass-produced vs. singular Divine.
- **Modern Relevance**: Pursued by Verain/University/Consortium; opportunities for salvage and upgrades; strong Aurion identity.

### B. Epsilon Frames
- **Definition & Role**: Autonomous machines for labor/mining/construction; gained self-awareness and turned hostile.
- **Historical Background**: Built for semi-independent operation; reactivated by mysterious Ether signals.
- **Key Characteristics**: Autonomous AI; modular self-scavenging; diverse body plans.
- **Variants & Subtypes**: Worker Drones; Striker Units; Overseer Cores (command).
- **Contrast**: Autonomy vs. pilot-required; below Divine in power.
- **Modern Relevance**: Global threat; Wardens destroy, Verain hack, University study; hooks for sabotage, salvage, diplomacy.

### C. Divine Frames
- **Definition & Role**: Mythic apex war machines; near-godlike Ether power; semi- or fully sentient.
- **Historical Background**: Ultimate Imperium project; catalyzed civil wars; likely contributed to the downfall; now legendary/hidden.
- **Key Characteristics**: Monumental scale; sentient Ether cores; reality-warping potential.
- **Known Exemplars (Rumored)**: Celestial Aegis (defensive shields), Obsidian Tyrant (devourer), Aurora Seraph (flying stormlord).
- **Contrast**: Singular scale/power vs. mass-produced frames; mystical Ether manipulation.
- **Modern Relevance**: Verain seeks, Wardens fear, Consortium trades; deep cultural resonance; high-stakes adventures.
