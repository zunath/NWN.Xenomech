## Resonance Nodes
Resonance Nodes are a manifestation of Ether resonance—a subtle link between a player’s experiences and their attunement to multiple Etheric disciplines, born from interplay between mastery in one class and exposure to another.

- **Etheric Imprint**: Each level in a class forms a unique Etheric imprint—vibrational echoes of that discipline within the character’s Etheric field.
- **Resonance Synergy**: As resonance reaches thresholds, it harmonizes with traces of other classes, forming a metaphysical bridge that channels abilities from those disciplines.

### Cultural and Historical Context
- The Aurion Imperium theorized “multi-focal attunement,” attempting artificial replication with catastrophic outcomes.
- Modern scholars (especially Aurion University) study Resonance Nodes as proof of deep interconnectivity between disciplines and Ether.

### Spiritual Interpretations
- Groups like the Chorus of Resplendence view Nodes as divine alignment within the Eternal Melody.

### Gameplay Implications
- Earned by leveling a primary class; functionality depends on exposure to a secondary class.
- Abilities accessed retain original mechanics and flavor.
- Enables dynamic storytelling and complex character legacies, embodying Arcanis’s interconnectedness.
