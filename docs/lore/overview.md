## Overview of Planet Arcanis

### Planetary Setting
Arcanis is a once-thriving world haunted by the downfall of its ancient Aurion Imperium. The Imperium’s Ether-powered marvels—mechs, warp gates, and relics—lie scattered across the planet, fueling modern conflicts between ambitious factions and wary defenders. Adventurers converge on the sprawling city-hub of Zenithia, where politics, trade, and innovation collide under the watchful gaze of the planet’s most powerful organizations.

### Major Regions

#### Zenithia (City Hub)
- A cosmopolitan fortress-city protected by partial Ether barriers.
- Home to political councils, a grand bazaar, and the prestigious Aurion University.
- Seat of House Verain’s estate and a neutral ground for delicate faction negotiations.

#### The Overgrown Expanse
- A lush jungle region choked with rampant vegetation, mutated fauna, and hidden Aurion bio-labs.
- Beastmaster clans defend sacred sites like the rumored “World-Tree,” while outsiders scour vine-choked ruins for potent botanical relics.

#### The Outlying Wastes
- An arid desert expanse littered with half-buried mech wrecks, broken warp gates, and scavenger camps.
- Nomadic tribes navigate ancient caravan routes, while House Verain outposts and Vanguard Wardens patrol the lawless sands.

#### The Crystal Ravines
- A labyrinth of jagged canyons rich with Ether-laced crystals that glow in moonlight.
- Mining guilds risk deadly crystal storms or cunning crystal-elementals in search of prized Ether shards.
- Feuds erupt over resource rights, with smuggling rings funneling black-market crystals into Zenithia.
