# Mech Customization Guide

This guide covers mech assembly strategies, optimization techniques, and build planning for different roles and playstyles.

## Assembly Fundamentals

### Stat Calculation System
All mech stats use percentage-based modifiers applied to base frame values:

**Formula**: `Final Stat = Base Frame Stat × (1 + Sum of All Part Modifiers)`

**Example**: 
- Aegis Mk I Base HP: 900
- Head Part: +15% HP
- Core Part: +20% HP  
- Final HP: 900 × (1 + 0.15 + 0.20) = 900 × 1.35 = 1,215 HP

### Heat and Fuel Balance
Critical considerations for sustainable operation:

**Heat Management**:
- Monitor total heat generation from all parts
- Ensure adequate cooling rate to prevent overheating
- Plan cooling cycles during extended combat

**Fuel Efficiency**:
- Balance fuel capacity with consumption rates
- Consider mission duration requirements
- Account for high-consumption abilities and weapons

**Recommended Parts**:
- **Head**: Oracle Command Node (+Team bonuses, -Personal defense)
- **Core**: Gaia Crystal Matrix (+Healing/Support, balanced)
- **Arms**: Apollo Surgical Arms (+Precision/Medical, -Durability)
- **Legs**: Stabilized Platform (+Accuracy/Support, balanced)
- **Generator**: Efficient Cell (+Fuel capacity/efficiency)
- **Weapons**: Repair Swarm + Shield Matrix (Team support tools)

**Strengths**: Excellent team support, sustained operations, utility
**Weaknesses**: Poor solo combat, relies on team protection

## Advanced Optimization

### Heat Cycle Management
Plan your heat generation and dissipation over combat encounters:

**Heat Buildup Phase** (Rounds 1-3):
- Use high-heat weapons for maximum damage
- Monitor heat levels approaching 75% threshold
- Prepare for cooling phase transition

**Cooling Phase** (Rounds 4-6):
- Switch to low-heat weapons or defensive actions
- Use active cooling abilities if available
- Allow passive cooling to reduce heat load

**Sustained Phase** (Rounds 7+):
- Maintain heat levels below 50% for optimal performance
- Use heat-efficient weapons and abilities
- Coordinate with team for covering fire during cooling

### Fuel Management Strategy
Plan fuel consumption for mission types:

**Short Engagements** (1-3 encounters):
- High-consumption builds viable
- Focus on peak performance over efficiency
- Acceptable to reach 50% fuel levels

**Extended Operations** (4+ encounters):
- Emphasize fuel efficiency parts
- Plan consumption rates carefully
- Maintain 75% fuel minimum for emergency capability

**Siege Warfare** (Prolonged combat):
- Maximum efficiency builds required
- Consider support builds with repair capability
- Coordinate team fuel management

### Stat Synergy Optimization
Identify parts that work well together:

**Offensive Synergy**:
- High Attack + High Accuracy parts = Reliable damage
- Attack + Heat Generation + Cooling Rate = Sustained offense
- Ether Attack + Fuel Capacity = Extended ability usage

**Defensive Synergy**:
- HP + Defense = Physical damage mitigation
- HP + Ether Defense = Energy attack resistance
- Defense + Evasion = Multi-layered protection

**Efficiency Synergy**:
- Fuel Capacity + Low Consumption = Extended operation
- Cooling Rate + Heat Capacity = Thermal efficiency
- All efficiency bonuses = Maximum uptime

## Team Build Coordination

### Balanced Team Composition
- **1 Tank Frame**: Aegis with fortress build for protection
- **2 Damage Frames**: Ravager with glass cannon builds  
- **1 Support Frame**: Herald with support specialist build

### All-Rounder Team
- **4 Hybrid Builds**: Each optimized for different scenarios
- Flexibility to adapt to changing battlefield conditions
- No single points of failure

### Specialized Team  
- **1 Fortress**: Ultimate defense and area control
- **1 Glass Cannon**: Maximum damage output
- **1 Speed Demon**: Reconnaissance and flanking
- **1 Support**: Team enhancement and logistics

## Experimental Builds

### Berserker Configuration
Push attack stats to extreme levels regardless of consequences:
- All parts focused on +Attack modifiers
- Accept major penalties to defense and heat management
- High-risk, high-reward playstyle

### Stealth Infiltrator  
Maximum evasion and minimal heat signature:
- Stack all +Evasion parts
- Use heat-neutral weapons only
- Focus on reconnaissance and precision strikes

### Overcharged Prototype
Use all experimental/exotic parts for maximum performance:
- Accept extreme penalties for incredible bonuses
- Requires expert heat and fuel management
- Unstable but potentially game-changing

### Living Fortress
Combine maximum HP with self-repair capabilities:

## Build Testing and Iteration

### Performance Metrics
Track these statistics to evaluate build effectiveness:
- **Damage Per Round**: Total damage output over time
- **Survivability Index**: HP × (Defense + Evasion)
- **Heat Efficiency**: Damage per heat point generated
- **Fuel Economy**: Actions per fuel point consumed

### Testing Scenarios
- **Burst Combat**: Short, high-intensity engagements
- **Sustained Combat**: Extended fight simulation
- **Mixed Encounters**: Variety of enemy types and situations
- **Team Scenarios**: Coordination with other mechs

### Optimization Process
1. **Baseline Test**: Record performance with current build
2. **Single Part Swap**: Change one part and retest
3. **Compare Results**: Identify improvements or degradation
4. **Iterative Refinement**: Continue optimizing based on results
5. **Final Validation**: Test complete build in realistic scenarios
