# Mech Combat System

The mech combat system integrates pilotable mechanical units into the existing combat framework while introducing unique mechanics for resource management, tactical positioning, and scale differences.

## Core Combat Mechanics

### Stat Integration
Mech stats replace pilot stats during mech combat:
- **HP**: Mech health pool (typically 3-5x player HP)
- **Attack/Ether Attack**: Offensive capabilities through weapons
- **Defense/Ether Defense**: Damage mitigation systems
- **Accuracy/Evasion**: Hit calculation modifiers

### Heat Management System
Heat buildup adds tactical depth without complex movement mechanics:

**Heat Generation**:
- Weapon usage generates heat based on power level
- High-performance parts increase heat generation
- Sustained combat operations build thermal load

**Heat Effects**:
- **0-50% Heat**: Normal operation, no penalties
- **51-75% Heat**: -10% Accuracy, -10% Attack effectiveness  
- **76-90% Heat**: -20% Accuracy, -20% Attack, -10% Evasion
- **91-100% Heat**: -30% all combat stats, risk of emergency shutdown

**Heat Dissipation**:
- Passive cooling each combat round
- Active cooling abilities and equipment
- Environmental effects (cold areas boost cooling)
- Part-based cooling rate modifiers

### Fuel Management System
Fuel consumption creates resource management without movement complexity:

**Fuel Usage**:
- All mech actions consume fuel
- High-power abilities cost more fuel
- Generator efficiency affects consumption rates

**Fuel States**:
- **100-75% Fuel**: Normal operation, full capabilities
- **74-50% Fuel**: -5% to all stats, fuel warning indicators
- **49-25% Fuel**: -15% to all stats, emergency power mode
- **24-1% Fuel**: -30% to all stats, critical power shortage
- **0% Fuel**: Emergency shutdown, extreme vulnerability

**Fuel Management**:
- Out-of-combat restoration (slow regeneration)
- Consumable refuel items for field operations  
- Generator part selection affects capacity and efficiency

## Scale and Targeting

### Mech vs Player Combat
When mechs fight against non-mech opponents:

**Mech Advantages**:
- 3-5x health pools provide survivability
- Area-effect weapons can target multiple opponents
- Superior firepower and armor systems

**Player Advantages**:
- Higher mobility and evasion capabilities
- Called shots can target specific mech subsystems
- Smaller profile harder to hit with mech weapons

**Balance Mechanics**:
- Mech weapons have accuracy penalties vs. small targets
- Players can exploit mech heat buildup and fuel consumption
- Environmental cover more effective against mech weapons

### Mech vs Mech Combat
Direct mech-to-mech combat emphasizes:

**Tactical Elements**:
- Heat management becomes critical
- Fuel consumption planning for extended engagements
- Part targeting and subsystem damage

**Advanced Mechanics**:
- **Subsystem Targeting**: Called shots against specific parts
- **Critical Hits**: Chance to disable or destroy components
- **Heat Warfare**: Weapons and abilities that increase enemy heat

## Combat Integration

### Existing Systems Compatibility
Mech combat integrates with current game mechanics:

**Job Abilities**: Most job abilities remain usable in mechs
- Physical abilities may be enhanced by mech capabilities
- Ether abilities benefit from mech ether systems
- Support abilities can target both mechs and pilots

**Weapon Skills**: Traditional weapon skills apply to mech weapons
- Relevant weapon skill bonuses affect mech weapons
- Tactical points (TP) generation continues in mech combat
- Weapon skill abilities may have enhanced effects

**Status Effects**: Standard effects apply with modifications
- Pilot-based effects may be filtered through mech systems
- Mech-specific status effects (overheating, power loss)
- Some effects may target the mech instead of pilot

### Team Combat Dynamics

**Mixed Formations**:
- Mechs provide heavy support for pilot teams
- Pilots offer mobility and precision support
- Combined arms tactics maximize effectiveness

**All-Mech Teams**:
- Emphasis on role specialization (Tank/Damage/Support/Ether)
- Coordinated heat and fuel management
- Strategic positioning and covering fire

**Mech Support Roles**:
- Herald frames excel at team coordination
- Repair and maintenance capabilities
- Resource sharing and field supply

## Environmental Factors

### Terrain Effects
Environmental conditions affect mech performance:

**Heat Environments**:
- Desert, volcanic areas increase heat generation
- Reduced cooling efficiency
- Fire-based attacks more effective

**Cold Environments**:
- Arctic, high-altitude areas improve cooling
- Reduced fuel efficiency in extreme cold
- Ice-based attacks more effective

**Urban Combat**:
- Buildings provide cover but limit mech mobility
- Civilian casualties become tactical consideration
- Infrastructure damage affects area control

### Mission Types

**Assault Operations**:
- Direct combat focused missions
- Emphasis on damage output and survivability
- Heat management crucial for sustained combat

**Siege Warfare**:
- Extended engagements requiring fuel efficiency
- Defensive positioning and area denial
- Cooling cycle coordination between team members

**Reconnaissance**:
- Stealth-focused builds with enhanced sensors
- Minimal heat signature and fuel consumption
- Information gathering and target designation

**Support Operations**:
- Logistics, repair, and area control missions
- Herald frames optimal for these operations
- Sustained operation capability prioritized

## Advanced Combat Features

### Electronic Warfare
- ECM systems jam enemy targeting
- Counter-electronic measures restore functionality
- Information warfare affects sensor capabilities

### Weapon Synergy
- Certain weapon combinations provide bonuses
- Energy weapons benefit from heat management
- Ballistic weapons offer heat-neutral options

### Emergency Systems
- Auto-ejection prevents pilot death on mech destruction
- Emergency cooling systems provide temporary heat relief
- Backup power allows limited operation at zero fuel

## Balance Considerations

### Power Scaling
- Level-gated frames prevent early-game dominance
- Resource costs limit casual mech usage
- Maintenance requirements create ongoing expenses

### Counterplay Options
- Heat-inducing abilities available to all classes
- EMP and disruption effects disable mech systems
- Environmental hazards affect mechs differently than pilots

### Team Balance
- Mixed mech/pilot teams remain viable
- No single mech build dominates all scenarios
- Support roles crucial for mech team success
