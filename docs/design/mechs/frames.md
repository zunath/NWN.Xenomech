# Mech Frames

Frames are the foundational chassis that determine a mech's role, base statistics, and level requirements. Each frame type specializes in different combat roles while maintaining distinct advantages and limitations.

## Frame Types

### Aegis Frames (Tank Role)
**Purpose**: Defensive specialists designed for damage absorption and battlefield control.

**Characteristics**:
- Highest HP and Defense values
- Moderate fuel capacity and cooling systems
- Lower damage output but excellent survivability
- Ideal for protecting allies and holding strategic positions

**Level Progression**:
- **Aegis Mk I** (Level 10): Entry-level tank frame for new pilots
- **Aegis Mk II** (Level 20): Enhanced armor and systems integration
- **Aegis Mk III** (Level 30): Professional-grade defensive platform
- **Aegis Mk IV** (Level 40): Military-standard siege breaker
- **Aegis Mk V** (Level 50): Elite fortress-class chassis

### Ravager Frames (Damage Role)
**Purpose**: Assault specialists optimized for maximum physical damage output.

**Characteristics**:
- Highest Attack statistics
- Moderate HP with higher fuel consumption
- Excellent accuracy and offensive capabilities
- Designed for hit-and-run tactics and elimination missions

**Level Progression**:
- **Ravager Mk I** (Level 10): Basic assault configuration
- **Ravager Mk II** (Level 20): Enhanced weapon systems
- **Ravager Mk III** (Level 30): Battle-tested destroyer frame
- **Ravager Mk IV** (Level 40): Advanced warfare platform
- **Ravager Mk V** (Level 50): Apex predator chassis

### Nexus Frames (Ether Role)
**Purpose**: Energy warfare specialists focused on ether-based combat and manipulation.

**Characteristics**:
- Highest Ether Attack values
- Superior cooling systems for energy weapons
- Moderate fuel capacity with efficient consumption
- Specialized for energy-based abilities and support

**Level Progression**:
- **Nexus Mk I** (Level 10): Basic ether manipulation frame
- **Nexus Mk II** (Level 20): Enhanced energy projection systems
- **Nexus Mk III** (Level 30): Advanced ether warfare platform
- **Nexus Mk IV** (Level 40): Master-class energy manipulator
- **Nexus Mk V** (Level 50): Transcendent ether channeler

### Herald Frames (Support Role)
**Purpose**: Utility specialists designed for team support and sustained operations.

**Characteristics**:
- Best fuel efficiency and capacity
- Balanced combat statistics
- Superior cooling systems
- Optimized for long-duration missions and team enhancement

**Level Progression**:
- **Herald Mk I** (Level 10): Entry-level support frame
- **Herald Mk II** (Level 20): Enhanced utility systems
- **Herald Mk III** (Level 30): Professional support platform
- **Herald Mk IV** (Level 40): Advanced logistics frame
- **Herald Mk V** (Level 50): Master-class command chassis

## Base Stat Distribution

Each frame type follows distinct stat progression curves:

### Tank (Aegis) Priority
1. **HP** - Primary defensive statistic
2. **Defense/Ether Defense** - Damage mitigation
3. **Heat Capacity** - Sustained operation capability
4. **Attack/Ether Attack** - Secondary offensive capability

### Damage (Ravager) Priority  
1. **Attack** - Primary offensive statistic
2. **Accuracy** - Hit reliability
3. **HP** - Survivability balance
4. **Heat Capacity** - Weapon operation support

### Ether (Nexus) Priority
1. **Ether Attack** - Primary energy offensive
2. **Ether Defense** - Energy attack mitigation  
3. **Cooling Rate** - Heat dissipation for energy weapons
4. **Fuel Capacity** - Power source for abilities

### Support (Herald) Priority
1. **Fuel Capacity** - Extended operation capability
2. **Fuel Efficiency** - Resource optimization
3. **Cooling Rate** - System maintenance
4. **Balanced Combat Stats** - Versatility

## Level Requirements

Frame access is gated by character level to ensure appropriate power scaling:

- **Mk I Frames** (Level 10): Accessible to new mech pilots
- **Mk II Frames** (Level 20): Experienced pilot tier
- **Mk III Frames** (Level 30): Veteran pilot platforms
- **Mk IV Frames** (Level 40): Elite pilot chassis
- **Mk V Frames** (Level 50): Master pilot frames

## Frame Selection Strategy

### New Pilots (Levels 10-19)
- Focus on frame type that complements your job class
- Prioritize survivability over peak performance
- Consider team composition needs

### Experienced Pilots (Levels 20-39)
- Experiment with different frame types
- Optimize part combinations for specific roles
- Balance personal preference with tactical requirements

### Veteran Pilots (Levels 40-50)
- Pursue specialized builds for specific scenarios
- Master heat and fuel management systems
- Lead team compositions with appropriate frames
