# Mech Parts

Parts are modular components that modify a mech's base frame statistics through percentage-based bonuses and penalties. Each part type serves specific functions and provides meaningful choices between different operational priorities.

## Part Categories

### Head Parts (Sensors & Control Systems)
Head parts control targeting, sensor capability, and pilot interface systems.

**Key Examples**:
- **Aegis-VII Combat Array**: Heavily armored sensor package (+HP/Defense, -Evasion)
- **Nexus Targeting Matrix**: Advanced targeting system (+Attack/Accuracy, -HP)  
- **Phantom Cloak Array**: Stealth technology (+Evasion, -Accuracy)
- **Oracle Command Node**: Command and control systems (+Ether Attack/Accuracy, -HP)

**Common Trade-offs**:
- Combat durability vs. sensor precision
- Stealth capability vs. offensive accuracy
- Processing power vs. physical protection

### Core Parts (Central Processing)
Core parts manage power distribution, computational processing, and structural integrity.

**Key Examples**:
- **Helios Fusion Core**: High-output power core (+Fuel/Heat, -Cooling)
- **Atlas Stability Matrix**: Reinforced systems (+HP/Defense, -Evasion)
- **Prometheus Logic Engine**: Advanced computation (+Fuel efficiency/Ether, -HP)
- **Abyss Void Engine**: Experimental dark energy (+High Ether stats, -Stability)

**Common Trade-offs**:
- Raw power output vs. thermal management
- Processing capability vs. physical durability  
- Stability vs. peak performance
- Standard tech vs. experimental capabilities

### Arm Parts (Manipulation & Weapon Mounts)
Arm parts provide weapon mounting, manipulation capability, and specialized systems. All arm parts come in matched L/R pairs.

**Key Examples**:
- **Destroyer-Class L/R Assault Arms**: Heavy weapon mounts (+Attack/HP, -Evasion)
- **Scalpel L/R Precision Arms**: Fine manipulation (+Accuracy/Ether Attack, -HP)
- **Aegis L/R Shield Arms**: Defensive systems (+Defense, -Attack)
- **Wraith L/R Phantom Arms**: Phase-shifting tech (+Evasion/Ether, -HP)

**Common Trade-offs**:
- Weapon mounting capacity vs. manipulation precision
- Offensive capability vs. defensive systems
- Physical strength vs. mobility
- Standard systems vs. exotic technology

### Leg Parts (Mobility & Stability)
Leg parts determine movement capability, firing stability, and terrain adaptation.

**Key Examples**:
- **Olympus Siege Platform**: Heavy assault platform (+HP/Defense, -Evasion)
- **Hermes Swift Legs**: Lightweight mobility (+Evasion/Efficiency, -HP)
- **Artemis Stabilized Legs**: Precision firing platform (+Accuracy, balanced stats)
- **Chronos Phase Legs**: Time-shifted movement (+All stats, -Stability)

**Common Trade-offs**:
- Mobility vs. weapon stability
- Speed vs. armor protection  
- Standard locomotion vs. specialized movement
- Reliability vs. exotic capabilities

### Generator Parts (Power Systems)
Generator parts control fuel capacity, power output, and thermal management.

**Key Examples**:
- **Helios Fusion Reactor**: High-energy fusion (+Fuel/Heat, -Cooling/Efficiency)
- **Gaia Efficient Cell**: Optimized power management (+Efficiency/Cooling, -Raw Power)
- **Zeus Arc Reactor**: Lightning-based power (+High Output, -Stability)
- **Abyss Void Reactor**: Dark energy harvester (+Extreme Power, -Safety)

**Common Trade-offs**:
- Fuel capacity vs. consumption efficiency
- Power output vs. heat generation
- Reliability vs. peak performance
- Standard tech vs. experimental power sources

### Weapon Parts (Armaments)
Weapon parts provide direct combat capability and specialized tools. Available for both L and R weapon slots.

**Key Examples**:
- **Plasma Devastator**: High-energy directed weapon (+Attack/Ether, +Heat/-Cooling)
- **Zeus Railgun**: Electromagnetic projectile weapon (+Attack/Accuracy, +Heat)
- **Aegis Shield Matrix**: Defensive energy projection (+Defense/Ether Defense, -Attack)
- **Gaia Repair Swarm**: Automated maintenance system (+HP/Support, -Combat)

**Common Trade-offs**:
- Raw damage vs. heat generation
- Accuracy vs. area effect
- Combat capability vs. utility functions
- Standard weapons vs. exotic technology

## Modification System

### Percentage-Based Scaling
All part bonuses and penalties are applied as percentage modifications to base frame stats:
- **Positive modifiers** enhance frame capabilities
- **Negative modifiers** represent trade-offs and limitations
- **Zero modifiers** indicate no effect on that stat

### Heat and Fuel Management
Many high-performance parts generate additional heat or consume more fuel:
- **Heat Capacity**: Maximum thermal load before penalties
- **Cooling Rate**: Heat dissipation per time unit
- **Fuel Consumption**: Resource cost for operations

### Balance Philosophy
Every part follows the principle of meaningful choice:
- **No "best" parts** - all parts have trade-offs
- **Situational advantages** - different parts excel in different scenarios
- **Build diversity** - multiple viable configurations for each role

## Part Quality and Rarity

### Standard Parts
Readily available through salvage, crafting, and vendors. Provide solid performance with clear trade-offs.

### Advanced Parts  
Higher-tier parts with enhanced bonuses but more severe penalties. Require rare materials or specialized acquisition.

### Experimental Parts
Cutting-edge technology with extreme stats in both directions. High risk, high reward configurations.

### Mythological Parts
Named parts based on legendary figures. Unique stat combinations and thematic designs.

## Assembly Strategy

### Complementary Builds
- Choose parts that enhance your frame's strengths
- Accept penalties that don't conflict with your role
- Example: Tank frame with defensive arms and stability legs

### Hybrid Builds  
- Balance frame weaknesses with compensating parts
- Trade peak specialization for versatility
- Example: Damage frame with utility arms and efficient generator

### Experimental Builds
- Push specific stats to extreme levels
- Accept major trade-offs for specialized performance
- Example: Speed-focused build with all mobility parts

### Heat/Fuel Optimization
- Balance power output with thermal management
- Consider fuel consumption for sustained operations
- Plan cooling cycles and resource management
