  accuracy:
    name: "Accuracy"
    description: "Targeting precision and hit probability"
    type: "combat"

  fuel_consumption:
    name: "Fuel Consumption"
    description: "Base fuel cost for operations and abilities"
    type: "efficiency"
    calculation: "base_frame_value * (1 + sum_of_part_modifiers)"

modifier_system:
  calculation_method: "percentage_based"
  description: "All part modifiers are applied as percentage changes to base frame stats"
  example: "Frame HP 1000 + Part +15% = 1150 final HP"
  
  positive_modifiers:
    description: "Bonuses that enhance frame capabilities"
    format: "+X%"
    effect: "Multiplies base stat by (1 + modifier/100)"
    
  negative_modifiers:
    description: "Penalties representing trade-offs and limitations"
    format: "-X%"  
    effect: "Multiplies base stat by (1 - modifier/100)"
    
  zero_modifiers:
    description: "No effect on the specified stat"
    format: "0"
    effect: "Base frame stat unchanged"


fuel_system:
  description: "Resource management system for sustained operations"
  
  fuel_levels:
    full:
      range: "100-75%"
      effects: "Normal operation, full capabilities"
      
    low:
      range: "74-50%"
      effects: "-5% to all stats, fuel warning indicators"
      
    critical:
      range: "49-25%"
      effects: "-15% to all stats, emergency power mode"
      
    emergency:
      range: "24-1%"
      effects: "-30% to all stats, critical power shortage"
      
    depleted:
      range: "0%"
      effects: "Emergency shutdown, extreme vulnerability"
  
  fuel_usage:
    all_actions: "Every mech action consumes fuel"
    high_power_abilities: "Advanced abilities cost more fuel"
    efficiency_modifiers: "Generator parts affect consumption rates"
    
  fuel_restoration:
    out_of_combat: "Slow passive regeneration when not in combat"
    consumables: "Field refuel items for emergency restoration"
    maintenance: "Full restoration during proper maintenance periods"

combat_integration:
  stat_replacement: "Mech stats replace pilot stats during mech combat"
  scale_multiplier: "Mech HP typically 3-5x pilot HP for survivability"
  
  job_ability_integration:
    physical_abilities: "Enhanced by mech capabilities"
    ether_abilities: "Benefit from mech ether systems"
    support_abilities: "Can target both mechs and pilots"
    
  weapon_skill_integration:
    skill_bonuses: "Traditional weapon skills affect mech weapons"
    tp_generation: "Tactical points continue to generate in mech combat"
    enhanced_effects: "Some abilities have increased effectiveness in mechs"

balance_considerations:
