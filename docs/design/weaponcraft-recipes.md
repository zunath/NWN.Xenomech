### Data Inconsistencies

Several recipes have missing quantity values or resref identifiers in their HQ versions:

- Aurion Alloy Knife +1 (Level 3): Missing HQ quantity
- Storm Harpoon +1 (Level 7): Missing HQ quantity  
- Shadowpiercer +1 (Level 8): Missing HQ quantity
- Multiple resref truncation issues due to length constraints

## Component Implementation Complete

### Component System Implementation
All 205 weaponcraft recipes now feature complete component specifications using the standardized resref system:

- **Component Coverage**: 100% complete (205/205 recipes)
- **Component System**: Fully implemented with NWN-compliant naming conventions
- **Component Categories**: Raw materials, refined components, enhancement catalysts, and finishing materials
- **Quantity System**: All component quantities properly specified
- **Resref Standards**: Components follow pattern `[discipline]_[type]_[tier]` for consistency

### Component Reference Tables
Detailed component specifications and resref mappings are available in the companion component documentation files. Each recipe utilizes 1-8 components from the standardized component library.

### Augmentation System
Augment Type and Augment Slots fields remain available for future enhancement system implementation.

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data Completion ✅ COMPLETE
1. ✅ **Component Specification**: All 205 recipes have complete component requirements
2. **Quality Fixes**: Resolve missing HQ quantities and resref issues (ongoing)
3. **Data Validation**: Implement automated checks for data integrity (ongoing)

### Phase 2: Content Completion (High Priority)  
1. **HQ Gap Filling**: Add HQ versions for 25 incomplete recipes
2. **Ultra Tier Review**: Determine if additional Ultra tier weapons are needed
3. **Balance Pass**: Ensure level progression and difficulty are appropriate

### Phase 3: System Integration (Medium Priority)
1. **Augmentation Design**: Create weapon augmentation system
2. **Cross-Skill Integration**: Ensure compatibility with other crafting disciplines
3. **Testing Framework**: Develop validation tools for recipe balance

## Developer Notes

- All recipes use the `Weaponcraft` skill designation
- Resref naming follows pattern: `{prefix}_{weapon_type}[_p1/_p2]` for quality tiers
- Throwing weapons typically produce quantities of 25 (Shuriken types)
- Weapon naming suggests elemental/thematic groupings (Aurion, Mythrite, Titan series, etc.)
- Level progression gaps suggest certain recipes may be moved between tiers during balancing
